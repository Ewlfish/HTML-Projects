What are marker stickers? Marker Stickers are white stickers that are really easy to detect on Infrared cameras. The right joy-con slides into the joy-con holder on the back of the cardboard piano. The Toy-Con Piano uses marker stickers to detect what key you are pressing, and then it would use that information to make the correct sound. On the back of a piano key there is a marker sticker. When you press a white key down, the back part of it goes up. The right Joy-Con’s IR (InfraRed) motion camera will see where it detects the marker sticker and make the correct sound. It knows which key is which, because there are two marker stickers behind the keyboard. It will use those two marker stickers to determine which key’s sound to make. There are springs on the top of the white keys so when you press down on it, it springs back up into place. On the back of the black keys, there are also marker stickers that the IR motion camera can detect. When you press a black key down, the same thing happens. The back goes up and reveals the marker sticker. Instead of using springs to move these keys back into place, the black pieces are simply just made to be heavier on it’s back, so gravity will move it back into place after you let go of the key.</h3></p>
